# discord-drawbot version 1.1
This is my discord's bot. If you things about an upgrade in **efficiency**, or if you see an **issue**, please tell me. Thanks a lot!

All useful functions have a documentation.

## files documentation
At starts, the bot create **3** .json files :
- config.json
- commandes.json
- morpion.json

### config.json
This file stocks your bot's **token** and **prefix** like this:
```json
{
  "token": "( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",
  "prefix": "!"
}
```
In `token`, you need to add your bot's token. And in `prefix`, the prefix your bot's will use without and restart. It's the only file that you need to change to run the bot by your own.
